## Typing Speed Test App

This app is build with React, Next.js and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## How to become a Typing Master ⌨️

It takes a while to get fast at typing. You have to type for at least 30 mins everyday until you reach a speed of 50 wpm. At 50, typing feels like magic, you are no longer looking at the keyboard, you think of a word and it just appears before you. Finding the keys almost becomes an involuntary action.✨✨✨

## But how do you get there ? 🧐

The Typing Speed Test App is a platform designed specifically for this purpose.
It helps you get from 0-50 wpm with a structured plan. 

Instead of typing a document for 30 min straight everyday, here you could do that in bursts of 60s. 

You could also choose the passage mode where the time runs until you complete the whole passage.

Each session comes in 3 difficulty levels, Easy, Medium and Hard.

## Stats and Tips 📈

At the end of each session, you are given your accuracy and time taken to complete the test. These are recorded and you could check this later to see your progress in the Stats sections.

One important rule 📢: Aim for maximum accuracy, that's what would make you invincible.
Try to maintain a very high accuracy and the typing skills would just follow you.

My secret tip 🤫: If a passage is particularly hard, try typing it for 30 mins, go about your day, *SLEEP* well and just try it again in the morning, you will most probably get close to passing the test this time around.
